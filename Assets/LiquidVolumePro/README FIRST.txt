Version history
---------------

Version 5.5
- Added "Use Light Direction" option to support day/night cycles

Version 5.4
- Current "Global Alpha" renamed to "Global Density". Added "Final Alpha Multiplier" option.

Version 5.2
- Added "MSAA Thickness Correction". Used only with irregular topology to cancel artifacts introduced with MSAA.
- [Fix] Fixed rendering issue when multiple irregular flasks are visible and use different thickness values

Version 5.1.1
- [Fix] Fixed VR ghosting issue when Depth Aware option is enabled

Version 4.6.1
- [Fix] Fixed PS4 compilation error

Version 4.6
- Added "Limit Vertical Range" option

Version 4.5
- Minimum Unity version required is now 2020.3.16
- Some shader optimizations related to point light support
- [Fix] Fixed issue when ignoring gravity and using multiple layers
- [Fix] Fixed material shader warning

Version 3.3
- API: added GetMeshVolumeWS, GetMeshVolumeWSUnderLevel, GetMeshVolumeWSFast, GetMeshVolumeWSUnderLevelFast methods. They return approximations of the mesh volume
- API: added optional "rotationCompensation" parameter to GetSpillPoint method
- [Fix] Fixed inspector overlap issue in Unity 2021.3.3 due to a reorderable list bug

Version 3.2.1
- Added new algorithms for "Rotation Level Bias" option. Now this option has 3 values: None, Fast and Accurate.
- API: added onPropertiesChanged event
- [Fix] Fixed color difference between multiple and non-multiple styles when in Linear Color Space

Version 3.1
- Added "Use Light Color" option (refers to directional light)
- Added option to disable noise to improve performance on lower end devices

Version 3.0.4
- Memory and loading optimizations when using many instances of same flask

- [Fix] Fixed spill point calculation issue

Version 1.5.2
- Improvement to spill point calculation and debug gizmo

Version 1.5.1
- [Fix] Noise texture is no longer saved in the scene which can increase its size when using many prefabs

Version 1.5
- Added analytical volume computation for more precise liquid surface calculation (video: https://youtu.be/l4Zu6neUqr8)
- API: added MoveToLiquidSurface. This method can approximate displacement and rotation caused by turbulences. New demo scene "Buoyancy" (video: https://youtu.be/33lAPeyqwTY)
